# GP_TeamB
Group Project for Team B

Project status: COMPLETED

Everything needed to run the program should be in this repository (including graphics)
- run Level 1 for the test level (made to make sure all parts work together correctly)
- run Level 2 for the more complex maze 

To play:
- When run, a window with the maze should open
- The player (red square) can be controlled using the arrow keys or WASD
- The object of the game is to move the player to the green circle without touching the walls
  - if player touches a wall they will be sent back to the start point
  - key count and passed gates will remain unchanged
- gates (yellow walls) will require a key to pass through them - simply move the player over keys to pick them up
  - a key will automatically be removed from the key count when there is at least one key in the inventory and the player passes a gate
  - if the player attempts to pass through a gate with no keys in inventory, player will be reset to the start point
 - good luck! (Level 2 is more challenging than it appears)
